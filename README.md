# facesite
a site for facial recognition for my friends


im going to be honest this was one of my first big web applications and first time hosting and I have not touched this project, it probably does not run correctly but the code is certainly there

basically the user inputs an image and the website returns which one of my friends looks the closest like the inputted image with a % simialrity.

here is an early picture I recovered
